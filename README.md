# Module 7 - final project

## Project

My research plan subject is "What value does Prismic bring to your project as a headless cms?"

I am making a website with Prismic + NextJS and a presentation about Prismic.  
[The website is live and you can visit it by clicking here.](https://apiko-prismic-qyr3k44rm-stefansnaerh.vercel.app/)

Its a design I made in module 6 design sprint.
[Here is the figma file if you want to see.](https://www.figma.com/file/iLa5eqOlEfRa3qOuHwxalK/S%C3%AD%C3%B0a-fyrir-D%C3%B6nu?node-id=303%3A219&t=BtarbpycRwtnEa6a-1)

ItÂ´s still not fully ready, the slider in the Um Okkur/about page is not working like it should and some elements are not fully responsive yet.

## Presentation

Im still working on the presentations but I will talk about prismic and its value, what I learned
and what I liked about it.

## Workshop

For the workshop I want participants to be able to add elements with their data through the Prismic client.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
